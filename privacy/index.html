                <p>Hello and I hope you're well.</p>
                <p>I wanted to let you all know that I am open, and able see patients. The only patients I cannot see are those who have a positive COVID-19 status. The surgery looks and feels a little different, as I have removed everything that doesn't need to be there, to ensure maximum cleanliness. I also look a little different in my PPE. I can assure you I am smiling under the mask and visor!</p>
                <p>I want to reassure you that I have made the clinic as safe as possible. These are the procedures that are in place:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All patients are screened the day before their appointment with questions relating to COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Patients are asked to wash their hands upon arrival to the clinic.</li>
                    <li>I am asking where possible that patients attend their appointments alone, unless the appointment is for a child or vulnerable adult, in which case I ask that only ONE chaperone attend.</li>
                    <li>I wear full PPE throughout the appointment (mask, visor, apron etc) which is changed for every patient.</li>
                    <li>Full and thorough hygiene measures are in place, including but not limited to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thorough cleaning of the treatment room and waiting areas with Chlor-Clean in between patients.</li>
                            <li>New disposable plinth covers (changed for every patient)</li>
                            <li>Waterproof and antibacterial pillow protectors (changed for every patient).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I have completed a full COVID-19 policy for the surgery which can be accessed <p style="display: inline;"><a href="/resources/iO-infection-risk-assessment-and-recording-policy-COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>PILATES UPDATE</strong></p>
                <p>I can now teach classes of 5 and one to one outside. This is obviously at the discretion of the weather! Social distancing rules apply, I cannot do any hands on correction or lend any equipment.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about Osteopathy or Pilates, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to seeing you soon,</p>
