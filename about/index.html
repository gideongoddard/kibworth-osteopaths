                <p>Hello to you all,</p>
                <p>Firstly, I hope you, and your loved ones are all well, and bearing up in this terrible situation.</p>
                <p>Sadly, due to Covid-19, I am currently unable to work at the Kibworth Medical Centre, however this is a temporary stop, and I am hoping to be back up and running in no time.</p>
                <p><strong>This does not mean I am not here to help you!</strong></p>
                <p>I am aware that many of my patients live alone, so if you would like a friendly phone call, let me know, and also to check you are feeling well in yourself. I care about you all, and I am still able to help you, just in slightly different ways at the moment.</p>
                <p>Please remember to keep active and mobile. Movement is medicine for your body! Do your exercises, and if you have any problems, please just get in touch. I am still able to provide advice, support, and prescribe suitable exercises, so if you tweak something gardening, give me a call. (All of those DIY jobs are getting done now!) Avoid the temptation to sit all day, please, keep active. I have uploaded some of my Pilates videos onto YouTube, please <a href="mailto:info@kibworthosteopaths.co.uk">email me</a> for the link as this also lets me screen you so I know you are safe to do them.</p>
                <p>I am regularly updating social media with some top tips for keeping safe whilst working from home, getting those ergonomics right is very important, please feel free to check them out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kibworthosteo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kibworthosteopaths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>
                <p>This is a truly difficult time for us all, in so many different ways. Keep safe, keep well, and keep in touch.</p>
                <p>Emily</p>

                    <h3>Emily Coombes (B'Ost Registered Osteopath)</h3>
                    <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website!</p>
                    <p>I qualified as an Osteopath in 2009 from the University College of Osteopathy (formerly the Brisitsh School of Osteopathy) and immediately began to work in Leicester in a well established practice, under experienced Osteopaths.</p>
                    <p>I worked there for 11 years, and learned invaluable skills, adding to those gained on my degree. In 2017 I decided it was time to spread my wings, so, I opened Kibworth Osteopaths at the Kibworth Medical Centre.</p>
                    <p>I chose to work in a GP surgery, as I wanted patients to feel they were in a safe environment, and I am also determined to get Osteopathy more widely known as a profession, as well increase public knowledge <a href="../osteopathy/">about Osteopaths</a> and what we do.</p>

                <p>I can honestly say I love my job, and no two days are ever the same, I remember in one day my youngest patient was 9 days old, and the oldest was 99 years old! It is a privilege when people say 'help', and I understand that this can take courage, and requires trust in me.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy working out what somebody has done injury-wise, and I am passionate about rehabilitation as well as injury prevention. This is why in 2019 I trained with HFE to become a Pilates instructor, and qualified in 2020 as a Pre/Post natal Pilates instructor.</p>
                    <p>I am blessed to be married to my best friend who is superman to me. In 2011 we began the greatest adventure, I had our son, closely followed by our daughter in 2012. Being a parent opened my eyes to a new world, which is when I trained in Cranial Osteopathy, as well as learning a huge amount about treating pregnant patients.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I am either outside with my family and dogs, walking or camping, or I am curled up with a book and my cat!</p>
