                <p>Hello to you all,</p>
                <p>Firstly, I hope you, and your loved ones are all well, and bearing up in this terrible situation.</p>
                <p>Sadly, due to Covid-19, I am currently unable to work at the Kibworth Medical Centre, however this is a temporary stop, and I am hoping to be back up and running in no time.</p>
                <p><strong>This does not mean I am not here to help you!</strong></p>
                <p>I am aware that many of my patients live alone, so if you would like a friendly phone call, let me know, and also to check you are feeling well in yourself. I care about you all, and I am still able to help you, just in slightly different ways at the moment.</p>
                <p>Please remember to keep active and mobile. Movement is medicine for your body! Do your exercises, and if you have any problems, please just get in touch. I am still able to provide advice, support, and prescribe suitable exercises, so if you tweak something gardening, give me a call. (All of those DIY jobs are getting done now!) Avoid the temptation to sit all day, please, keep active. I have uploaded some of my Pilates videos onto YouTube, please <a href="mailto:info@kibworthosteopaths.co.uk">email me</a> for the link as this also lets me screen you so I know you are safe to do them.</p>
                <p>I am regularly updating social media with some top tips for keeping safe whilst working from home, getting those ergonomics right is very important, please feel free to check them out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kibworthosteo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kibworthosteopaths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>
                <p>This is a truly difficult time for us all, in so many different ways. Keep safe, keep well, and keep in touch.</p>
                <p>Emily</p>

                <h3>What are the benefits of Pilates?</h3>
                <p>Regular Pilates can help with all of the following:</p>

                    <div class="qa-box">
                        <div class="qa-q">
                            <h4>Improved posture</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-a">
                            <p>All the exercises performed in Pilates classes help to promote skeletal alignment. In addition, they strengthen the muscles which are responsible for good posture.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="qa-box">
                        <div class="qa-q">
                            <h4>Improved balance</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-a">
                            <p>Many Pilates exercises help to improve balance, this has many practical benefits in your day to day life, such as improved movement co-ordination, increasing agility and reaction times, to name a few.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="qa-box">
                        <div class="qa-q">
                            <h4>Reduced injury risk</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-a">
                            <p>As mentioned, Pilates does an excellent job of improving posture, as well as strengthening your muscles. It also strengthens joints and improves flexibility. These things combined can help reduce injury that could be picked up doing other sports, or indeed during day to day life.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="qa-box">
                        <div class="qa-q">
                            <h4>Enhanced core stability</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-a">
                            <p>One of the 6 Pilates Principles is ‘centering’, meaning that all the exercises begin with core engagement. Performing the exercises in this way means that the deep muscles in the abdomen, lower back and pelvic floor are strengthened, so providing the body with a good level of stability.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="qa-box">
                        <div class="qa-q">
                            <h4>Improved flexibility</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-a">
                            <p>Pilates involves dynamic movements. This means that muscles are gently stretched and lengthened, which increases the range of movement in the joints, which increases your overall flexibility.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="qa-box">
                        <div class="qa-q">
                            <h4>Increased strength</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-a">
                            <p>Pilates strengthens all the muscles in the body by using a combination of dynamic and static strength training, and no muscles get left out! One of the best things about Pilates is that functional strength is developed as well as muscle endurance which can then benefit day to day life!</p>
