                            <p>At the first consultation, the Osteopath will complete a full case history of your symptoms, as well as asking for information about your lifestyle. The Osteopath may also observe you making some simple movements to help them make the diagnosis. You will usually be asked to remove some clothing near to the area of the body to be examined.</p>
                            <p>Osteopaths are trained to examine areas of the body using a highly developed sense of touch, known as palpation, to determine conditions and identify the body's points of weakness or excessive strain. Osteopathy is a 'package' of care that includes skilled mobilising and manipulative techniques, reinforced by guidance on diet and exercise.</p>
                            <p> The Osteopath will discuss with you the most appropriate treatment plan estimating the likely number of sessions needed to treat your condition effectively. If the Osteopath thinks that your condition is unlikely to respond to Osteopathic treatment, you will be advised about how to seek further care. Osteopaths are skilled in diagnostic techniques and trained to identify when a patient needs to be referred to a GP.</p>

                            <p>An Osteopath is a primary care professional, focusing on the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal disorders and the effects of these conditions on patients' general health.</p>
                            <p>Using many of the diagnostic proceedures applied in conventional medical assessement, Osteopaths seek to restore the optimal functioning of the body, where possible without the use of drugs or surgery.</p>
                            <p>Osteopathy is based on the principle that the body has the ability to heal, and Osteopathic care focuses on stengthening the musculoskeletal systems to treat existing conditions and to prevent illness.</p>
                            <p>Osteopaths' patient centered approach to health and well-being means they consider symptoms in the context of the patient's full medical history, as well as their lifestyle and personal circumstances. This holistic approach ensures that all treatment is tailored to the individual patient.</p>

                            <p>Osteopathy focuses on the diagnosis, management, treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal and other related disorders without the use of drugs or surgery.
